      New South Wales is currently experiencing an outbreak of COVID, due to the delta
      variant. On June 26th, after a concerning increase in case numbers, the Greater
      Sydney area was placed under lockdown restrictions, and other restrictions were
      imposed in regional New South Wales.
    </p>

    How have New South Wales' restrictions affected the spread of the virus? The below
    plot shows how the effective reproduction number of the virus,
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has changed over time in New South Wales, as well as how the
    daily cases have changed over time. A trendline shows the approximate trajectory
    daily case numbers would follow, were the reproduction number of the virus to remain
    at its current level.
  </p>

  <h3>Non-isolating cases only</h3>
  <p>
    Cases isolating during their infectious period represent a much lower risk of spread.
    The growth rate of non-isolating cases represents a more leading indicator of whether
    NSW is successfully suppressing the outbreak. The below plot is identical to the above
    one, except it includes only cases that were not isolating for their full infectious
    period.

  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>
    The plotted trend is a simple extrapolation of what will happen if
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current value. This does not take into account
    that things are in a state of flux. As restrictions take effect, the virus should have
    fewer opportunities for spread, and <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> will decrease. If
    restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact tracing may suppress spread to a
    greater or lesser degree over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people each
    infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>
    to vary randomly in time. As such the projection should be taken with a grain of
    salt—it is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.
  </p> 

<!--   <h3>Data note</h3>
  <p>
    I use the "true" daily case numbers available from NSW health. These do not necessarily
    match the "new" daily case numbers announced each morning in press conferences. The
    latter can include cases that actually tested positive in prior days and were included
    in the numbers late due to data delays, whereas the former is retroactively modified to
    assign cases to the date they tested positive. Hence the "true" cases are a better
    representation of the progression of the virus and allow a more accurate estimate of
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "true" case numbers dataset is not updated for some time after the "new" case
    numbers are announced each day, so in the mornings (and on weekends, if NSW health
    have not updated their dataset) this plot is updated using the "new" case numbers
    instead for the missing data. This is then corrected later once the "true" dataset
    is updated by NSW health.
  </p> -->

  <h3>Methodology</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Daily case numbers have been smoothed with 4-day Gaussian smoothing:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>N</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
      (2<i>πT</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> /
      2<i>T</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>s</sub> = 4 days
      and ∗ is the convolution operation.
    </li>

    <li>
      Before smoothing, the daily case numbers are padded on the right with an
      extrapolation based on a exponential fit to the most recent 10 days of data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is then calculated for each day as:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = (<i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) / <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>))<sup><i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> = 5 days is the approximate generation time of the virus.
    </li>
    <li>
      The uncertainty in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has contributions from the uncertainty
      in the above-mentioned exponential fit, as well as Poisson uncertainty in daily
      case numbers, and an additional 20% uncertainty in daily case numbers - the latter
      is just a crude eyeballed figure of observed day-to-day fluctuations.
    </li>
    <li>
      The extrapolation of daily case numbers is based on exponential growth/decay using the most recent value of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and its uncertainty range:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>extrap</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
      <sup>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i> - <i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)/<i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
