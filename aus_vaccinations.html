    <h2 id="daily">Daily doses by state/territory</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of daily vaccine doses administered in Australia, by
      state/territory. These are compared to the average rate required for 40 million
      doses to be administered by the end of October (160k doses per day), which is
      approximately what Australia is targeting (though recent developments make it likely
      that this target will be revised).
    </p>
    <p>
      The data is smoothed using Gaussian smoothing with Ïƒ=2 days to better show the
      trend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply, the assumptions in the <a
      href="#utilisation">Estimated utilisation</a> section below, and the assumption
      that 10% of available doses each day are utilised: administered as first doses or
      reserved for second doses. That is in effect assuming that we will always be about
      10 days away from exhausting available doses. This projection reflects current
      supply expectations and is subject to change.
    </p>
    <img src="daily_doses_by_state.svg">
    <h2 id="utilisation">Estimated utilisation</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of the estimated status of each vaccine dose in Australia. How many
      doses are in people's arms, in reserve, or available? This helps show whether
      administration of doses is keeping up with supply. Since the government has not
      published data to determine this exactly, this estimate is based on a number of
      assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          That the number of Pfizer and AstraZeneca first doses administered on a given
          day is in proportion to the number of available doses of each type of vaccine on
          that day.
        </li>
        <li>
          That for every first dose administered a second dose is held in reserve, and
          administered exactly 3 weeks later for Pfizer, or 12 weeks later for
          AstraZeneca.
        </li>
        <li>
          That doses becoming available in a given week (supply data is only available at
          the 1-week level) become available on the Wednesday of that week.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This estimate ignores possible wastage of vaccines.
    </p>
    <img src="utilisation.svg">
    <h2 id="utilisation_by_type">Estimated utilisation by vaccine type</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the same utilisation estimates as in the above plot, but separated by
      vaccine type: AstraZeneca vs Pfizer.

    <h2 id="cumulative">Cumulative doses</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, here is a simple plot of cumulative doses in Australia over time,
      compared to a hypothetical rollout at a constant rate toward the end of October
      target of 40M doses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply, the assumptions in the <a
      href="#utilisation">Estimated utilisation</a> section above, and the assumption
      that 10% of available doses each day are utilised: administered as first doses or
      reserved for second doses. That is in effect assuming that we will always be about
      10 days away from exhausting available doses. This projection reflects current
      supply expectations and is subject to change.
