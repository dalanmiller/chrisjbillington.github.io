    <h2 id="daily">Daily doses by administration channel</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of 7-day average of daily vaccine doses administered in Australia
      by administration channel, showing the daily number of doses administered by state
      vaccination clinics, and by GPs and in federally operated aged and disability
      care. The 7-day average is further smoothed to remove day-to-day random
      fluctuations using Gaussian smoothing with Ïƒ=1 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply smoothed over several weeks after
      supply becomes available, the asumption that second doses are reserved and
      administered on time as described in the <a href="#utilisation">Estimated
      utilisation</a> section, and allowing for 10% wastage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Data note: 80,560 GP-administered doses were reported on April 19th that were
     administered "prior to April 17". These have been incorporated into the data by
     spreading them over the period from March 22nd (start of phase 1b) to April 16th in
     proportion to the daily rate of GP-adminsitered doses on each day.
    </p>
    <img src="daily_doses_by_state.svg">
    <h2 id="cumulative">Cumulative doses</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a simple plot of cumulative doses in Australia over time by
      administration channel, showing the cumulative number of doses administered by
      state vaccination clinics, and by GPs and in federally operated aged and
      disability care. Australia aims to vaccinate all 20M adults (requiring 40M doses)
      by the end of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply smoothed over several weeks after
      supply becomes available, the assumption that second doses are reserved and
      administered on time as described in the <a href="#utilisation">Estimated
      utilisation</a> section, and allowing for 10% wastage.
    </p>
    <img src="cumulative_doses.svg">
    <h2 id="longproject">Longer-term projections</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a possible scenario for the vaccination program over the course of the
      year. This assumes that we keep up with supply, administering doses in the weeks
      following them becoming available until 20M people have been vaccinated, with a
      maximum of 8M people receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assumes second doses are reserved and administered on time as described in
      the <a href="#utilisation">Estimated utilisation</a> section, and allows for 10%
      wastage.
    </p>
    <p>

      Expected supply of the Pfizer vaccine (based on comments from Greg Hunt <a
      href="https://youtu.be/NnwVpSmFh2k?t=1830">here</a> and <a
      href="https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/press-conference-in-canberra-with-minister-hunt-professor-brendan-murphy-in-canberra-on-13-may-2021with-an-update-on-the-vaccination">here</a>)
      is 350k doses per week until July, then 700k per week until October, and then
      2.18M per week until the end of the year for a total of 40M doses in 2021.

    <h2 id="utilisation">Estimated utilisation</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of the estimated status of each vaccine dose in Australia. How many
      doses are in people's arms, in reserve, or available? This helps show whether
      administration of doses is keeping up with supply. Since the government has not
      published data to determine this exactly, this estimate is based on a number of
      assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          That the number of Pfizer and AstraZeneca first doses administered on a given
          day is in proportion to the number of available doses of each type of vaccine
          on that day.
        </li>
        <li>
          That 50% of Pfizer supply is held in reserve for second doses, administered
          exactly 3 weeks after the first dose.
        </li>
        <li>
          That 50% of AstraZeneca supply is held in reserve for second doses,
          administered exactly 12 weeks after the first dose.
          <!-- Prior to mid-April, that 50% of AstraZeneca supply is held in reserve for
          second doses. After mid-April (when the government became confident enough in
          local supply to maintain a smaller reserve), that a reserve is maintained with
          a number of doses equal to half of all outstanding second doses. These second
          doses are administered exactly 12 weeks after the first dose. -->
        </li>
        <li>
          That doses becoming available in a given week (supply data is only available
          at the 1-week level) become available at the end of that week.
        </li>
        <li>
          That 10% of doses are wasted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Below is the same utilisation estimates as in the above plot, but separated by
      vaccine type: AstraZeneca vs Pfizer.
