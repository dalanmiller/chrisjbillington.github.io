    <h1>
      Australian COVID vaccination rollout
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Daily doses
    </h2>

    Below is a plot of daily vaccine doses administed in Australia, by state/territory.
    These are compared to the average rate required for 40 million doses to be
    administered by the end of October 160k doses per day, which is approximately what
    Australia is targeting.

    The data is smoothed using Gaussian smoothing with Ïƒ=2 days. If the federal
    government has not released data recently, the most recent daily rate (after
    smoothing) from reported data is used to project the missing data. If this is the
    case, this will be indicated separately on the plot.

    <h2>
      Utilisation
    </h2>
    Below is a plot of the estimated status of each vaccine dose in Australia. How many
    doses are in people's arms, in reserve, or available? This helps show whether
    administration of doses is keeping up with supply. Since the government has not
    published data to determine this exactly, this estimate is based on a number of
    assumptions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        That the number of Pfizer and Astrazeneca first doses administered on a given
        day is in proportion to the number of available doses of each type of vaccine on
        that day.
      </li>
      <li>
        That for every first dose adminsiterd a second dose is held in reserve, and
        administered exactly 3 weeks later for Pfizer, or 12 weeks later for
        AstraZeneca.
      </li>
      <li>
        That doses becoming available in a given week (supply data is only available at
        the 1-week level) become available on the Wednesday of that week.
      </li>
    </ul>
    This estimate ignores possible wastage of vaccines.

    <h2>
      Cumulative doses
    </h2>
    Finally, here is a simply plot of cumulative doses in Australia over time, compared
    to a hypothetical rollout at a constant rate toward the end of October target of 40M
    doses.
