    <h2 id="daily">Daily doses by state/territory</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of daily vaccine doses administered in Australia, by
      state/territory.
      The data is smoothed using Gaussian smoothing with Ïƒ=2 days to better show the
      trend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply, the assumptions in the <a
      href="#utilisation">Estimated utilisation</a> section below, and the assumption
      that 10% of available doses each day are utilised: administered as first doses or
      reserved for second doses. That is in effect assuming that we will always be about
      10 days away from exhausting available doses. This projection reflects current
      supply expectations and is subject to change.
    </p>
    <img src="daily_doses_by_state.svg">
    <h2 id="cumulative">Cumulative doses</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a simple plot of cumulative doses in Australia over time. Australia aims to vaccinate all 20M adults (requiring 40M doses) by the end of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on expected supply, the assumptions in the <a
      href="#utilisation">Estimated utilisation</a> section below, and the assumption
      that 10% of available doses each day are utilised: administered as first doses or
      reserved for second doses. That is in effect assuming that we will always be about
      10 days away from exhausting available doses. This projection reflects current
      supply expectations and is subject to change.
    </p>
    <img src="cumulative_doses.svg">
    <h2 id="longproject">Longer-term projections</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a possible scenario for the vaccination program over the course of the
      year. This assumes that we keep up with supply, administering 10% of available
      first-doses per day until 20M people have been vaccinated, with a maximum of 8M
      people receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. Expected supply of the Pfizer vaccine is
      40M doses over the year, arriving according to a schedule hinted at in <a
      href="https://youtu.be/NnwVpSmFh2k?t=1830">comments from Greg Hunt</a>, which
      whilst not very specific, are enough to get a rough idea of how things might
      proceed over the year. Supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine is assumed to be 670k per
      week, which is probably an underestimate as it is expected to reach 1M per week
      "soon". Supply of Pfizer is assumed to be 170k per week until mid-May, then 250k
      per week until July, then 600k per week until October, and then at whatever rate
      is required to reach 40M doses by the end of the year.

    <h2 id="utilisation">Estimated utilisation</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of the estimated status of each vaccine dose in Australia. How many
      doses are in people's arms, in reserve, or available? This helps show whether
      administration of doses is keeping up with supply. Since the government has not
      published data to determine this exactly, this estimate is based on a number of
      assumptions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          That the number of Pfizer and AstraZeneca first doses administered on a given
          day is in proportion to the number of available doses of each type of vaccine
          on that day.
        </li>
        <li>
          That 50% of Pfizer supply is held in reserve for second doses, administered
          exactly 3 weeks after the first dose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prior to mid-April, that 50% of AstraZeneca supply is held in reserve for
          second doses. After mid-April (when the government became confident enough in
          local supply to maintain a smaller reserve), that a reserve is maintained with
          a number of doses equal to half of all outstanding second doses. These second
          doses are administered exactly 12 weeks after the first dose.
        </li>
        <li>
          That doses becoming available in a given week (supply data is only available
          at the 1-week level) become available at the end of that week.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Below is the same utilisation estimates as in the above plot, but separated by
      vaccine type: AstraZeneca vs Pfizer.
